#### About Author

I was born in the Philippines but I've been living in Los Angeles since I was nine (the building pictured is in Downtown LA). I'm currently studying at Pomona College for mathematics and statistics. I love crafting, specifically knitting and sewing (the image on my home page is a design that I sewed onto a shirt).

#### About this site

This site currently contains projects for my Foundations of Data Science DS002 class.
