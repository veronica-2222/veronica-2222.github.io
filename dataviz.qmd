### Some of the work I've done: 

-   Carbon Majors Emissions and Chocolate Ratings are visual analyses using data from TidyTuesday

-   Text Analysis uses regular expressions to analyze data

-   A Simulation Study uses visual inference to conduct a hypotheses test.

-   SQL contains my work using SQL to analyze a database and R to create visuals
